;;; Commentary:

;; `in-memory-diff' takes two source buffers and treats their content
;; as a set of unordered lines, as one would excpect for a file like
;; ~/.authinfo.gpg, for example.  We don't use diff(1) to diff the
;; buffers and thus we don't write temporary files to disk.  The result
;; is two buffers, *A* and *B*.  Each contains the lines the other
;; buffer does not contain.  These files are in a major mode with the
;; following interesting keys bindings:
;;
;; c â€“ copy the current line to the other source buffer
;; k - kill the current line from this source buffer
;; RET - visit the current line in this source buffer
;;
;; In theory, using c and k on all the lines should result in the two
;; source containing the same lines a subsequent call of
;; in-memory-diff showing two empty buffers.
